	abstract = {Evolution has a key role to play as we push towards Artificial General Intelligence ({AGI}), mainly for three reasons. Firstly the neural evolution and the evolutionary algorithms communities have developed a lot of important ideas that have a role to play in general {AI} research whether or not they ultimately are used on an evolutionary backbone or they're hybridized with other ideas. Secondly evolutionary algorithms themselves may be a key technology for evolution in terms of having a part to play in the overall solution to {AI}. Third, to some extent these names for different fields are metaphorical and so if one thinks about evolution a little bit more broadly as the outer loop learning algorithm which is to say that we have something that kind of moves and learns across generations and then something that learns within a lifetime that outer loop which in nature is evolution and in machine learning sometimes is specifically an evolutionary algorithm or sometimes could be, say reinforcement learning algorithm that outer loop that is definitely going to be critical as we push towards {AGI} and some will call evolution, and some will fail to call it evolution. But at its heart, we're taking inspiration from natural evolution and evolutionary algorithms to do that outer loop activity, and that's essential. So in many different ways, evolutionary algorithms are going to be essential to our push towards {AI}, and we will increasingly see that the machine learning community is starting to take note and play with a lot of the ideas from evolution under its various interpretations and definitions.
